# Comment 6 ‚ú®

With ‚ù§Ô∏è by Dragon's Lover.

Comment 6 is a way to decorate your code with titles and separator lines to organize the portions of a file. I have always had a really hard time to keep track of where a function starts and where it ends. While there are millions of ways to tackle the problem, I simply wanted to have what I had in notebooks: good old lines.

With Comment 6 you can simply create these headings:

And edit them whenever you want:

## Notes üí°

- **Indentation Matters** &mdash; The way comment works is that you pick an empty line and indent as far as you wish your comment is going to be indented. You then start typing the comment and then use the menu or keybindings to generate the comment. The size and indentation of your resulting comment is determined by that indentation.

- **Only Use These Comments To Create Logical Parts In Your Codes** &mdash; Try to separate, types, functions, classes, the parts of the classes. The More organized you are the better.

- **Adopt The Clarity Style To Your Codes** &mdash; Try to have files that are minimal as possible. Have one class per file if you can. When a file move to more than a few hundred lines try to break it into different files. Try to write the best code you can. It always pays the efforts.

## Keybindings
